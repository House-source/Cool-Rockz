## Security Measures Implemented

- **Force HTTPS**  
  Ensures all traffic is encrypted.

- **Session Timeout Handling**  
  Automatically logs out users after 20 minutes of inactivity.

- **Session-based Access Control**  
  Validates `$_SESSION['user_id']` and `$_SESSION['is_admin']` on restricted pages.

- **Password Hashing**  
  Uses `password_hash()` to store passwords securely.

- **SQL Injection Protection**  
  All queries use prepared statements (via PDO).

- **CSRF Protection**  
  Tokens are generated and verified for forms that modify data.

- **Output Escaping**  
  Uses `htmlspecialchars()` to prevent XSS when rendering user-submitted content.
